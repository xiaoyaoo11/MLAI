## Optimized Learner Class Explanation

### 1. Improved Initialization

The new `Learner` class takes direct model and data components as parameters, making it more flexible and reusable:

- Takes pre-configured model, dataloaders, optimizer, and loss function
- Supports optional learning rate scheduler
- Automatically detects and uses GPU if available
- Supports loading pre-trained weights

### 2. Key Methods

#### `train` Method

- Trains the model for a specified number of epochs
- Tracks and returns comprehensive training history (losses and accuracies)
- Implements early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Supports learning rate scheduling
- Provides detailed progress reporting
- Automatically saves the best model based on validation accuracy

#### `test` Method

- Evaluates model performance on any dataset
- Returns both loss and accuracy metrics
- Can be used with any compatible dataloader

#### `inference` Method

- Performs prediction on a single image
- Handles image preprocessing automatically
- Returns human-readable class names when available

### 3. Optimizations

1. **Device Agnostic**: Automatically uses GPU when available for faster training
2. **Type Annotations**: Comprehensive type hints for better code quality and IDE support
3. **Flexible Architecture**: Works with any PyTorch model, not limited to specific architectures
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Proper handling of tensors and gradients
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing dependencies and files
6. **Checkpoint Management**: Saves both model weights and full training state
7. **Performance Tracking**: Measures and reports training time

### 4. Usage Example

The file includes a comprehensive example showing how to:

- Set up a model with pre-trained weights
- Configure dataloaders, optimizer, and loss function
- Create a Learner instance
- Train the model with early stopping
- Evaluate on a test set
- Perform inference on new images

This implementation follows modern PyTorch best practices and provides a clean, reusable interface for training deep learning models.
